// Lyrics
// 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

// 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

// ...and so on...

// 3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.

// 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

// 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

// No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
// Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
